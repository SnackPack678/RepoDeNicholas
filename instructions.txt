Steps for running the GUI:

1.) cd /Users/nicholasrubio/TaskManagerGUI
2.) Enter: ./TaskManagerGUI

	TaskManager™'s GUI is only capable of:

	• Creating a new Task
	• Naming the Task
	• Describing the Task
	• Setting the Priority Level of the Task

* It's important to note that despite TaskManager™' GUI limitation,
  IT STILL follows the constraints set fourth by the source code 
  from TaskManager™ main.cpp file. Meaning, it still:

	• Checks character length constraint of name
	• Checks character length constraint of description
	• Ensures priorityLevel is within range (1-10)
	• Null checking is built in
	• Warning/Error messages are displayed to user
